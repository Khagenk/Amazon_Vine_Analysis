# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
The task of this Chellenge module was to analyze Amazon Reviews written by member of the paid Vine program. Amazon Vine is a program that enables a select group of Amazon customers to post opinions about new and pre-release items to help their fellow customers to make informed purchase decisions.

Data from Amazonâ€™s video games department for US based reviewers was analyzed to determine if having a paid vine review makes difference in the percentage of 5- star reviews. 

In this Challenge the Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) process was used to create a dataset. In addition, Amazon AWS RDS (S3 buckets)  was also used to to create the Video game dataset. From there pgAdmin was utilized to connect with AWS, and creat different DataFrames to match schemas

# Summary
Based of the analysis of the Amazon Video Game reviews,
Vine reviews did not affect 5- star reviews. Given the analysis, 
although, Vine reviews had more 5-Star reviews, sheer amount of 
number of unpaid 5-star reviews is undeniable. Further analysis is required.
Also, next analysis for category/genera of video games would be an intreating 
analysis to run to provided more useful data for video game maker on their next 
project.
